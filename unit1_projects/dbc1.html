			<h2>A little bit about me...</h2>

			<h4>Summing up the little details that make up who you are can be tough, but I’ll try my best..</h4>

			<p><span id = "inlineHeader">Born in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea" target="_blank">South Korea</a>,</span> I traveled with my parents to New Jersey with me as a little tyke, who could barely speak two words of English. I remember I had an especially hard time with the word–”diamond”. (Anybody else out there who shared my pain?!)</p>

			<p>Picked up the language pretty quickly, and before I could walk, I was dancing and singing–jiving to the tunes of Mary Poppins, Michael Jackson, and any funky records I could get my chubby little hands on.</p>

			<p>I found a passion for biochemistry, and made it my objective to become a doctor, without realizing that the job title was a life style and not just an avenue for financial comfort. I managed to turn a blind eye to this until recently, I realized that coding was an avenue to something beyond just the monetary. It was a tool to build on top of the cultural phenomenon that was taking the world by storm: the Internet. Not only was this “hip and groovy” (or “bomb” depending on the generation you find comfort in), it was something I genuinely enjoyed and made time melt away. Ruby was my first language, and suddenly time was measured in lines of code; the day began and ended with <b>DEF</b> and <b>END</b> keywords.</p>

			<p>Fortunately, I realized that coding my day away was nothing without the people I could share my efforts with. I love communicating with people who share my passions, and am humbled and extended by those who are different and radical. I love mixing with people to create something.</p>

			<p>This website is the digital home and mental repository of an explorer of web development and music. Feel free to reach out to me. I enjoy giving autographs and faking them (if you are ever in desperate need of George Clooney’s.. I do a great one).</p>

			<h3>Two Truths, <i>One Lie</i></h3>
			<ul>
				<li>I have burned off both eyebrows while trying to make s'mores.</li>
				<li>I love Tostitos cheese dip.</li>
				<li>One of my ears is lower than the other.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Ironic Situations</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>"No flash photography in the photography exhibit."</li>
				<li>"A fire extinguisher that caught on fire."</li>
				<li>"An American flag stitched and made in China."</li>
