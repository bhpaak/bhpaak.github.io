				<h3>Codecademy</h3>
				<p class="content">
					This web page offers the user the opportunity to learn how to code for free. The problem that is solved is the main question: what does this website immediately offer the user? This website immediately gives a statement of purpose and a call to action in the form of a pink "sign-up" button. The visual challenge could also be its greatest strength. After staying on the home page for a while, the website can seem like a dull grey slate; however, the pink button is quick to draw attention because there is nothing else on the site to pay attention.

				<h3>Apple</h3>
				<p class="content">
					A company as reputable as Apple can afford to pay less attention to giving its customer a statement of purpose and more on a streamlined design that can direct the customer to more information on its famous products. Right away, it's most recent and popular product is available in the form of a graphic that provides a link to a video that offers more information. The bottom displays more graphics that provide avenues to view more of Apple's recent developments and innovations. For customers with a more specific interest in mind, the top menu bar succintly lays out links to company product pages.

				<h3>Manga Stream</h3>
				<p class="content">
					A website that posts scans of new chapter releases of various manga series should find a way to effectively display new chapters that have been posted. Manga Stream has found a way to do that in a way that draws the user's eye rather quickly but allows space for a blog. There's also a visual battle between space and purpose. Oftentimes, I find that the object that takes up the most space draws the most attention. Depending on the goal of the developer/designer, they might want to adjust the positioning of the table of manga chapter posts and blog entries.
