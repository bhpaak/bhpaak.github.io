						<p class="website_name">Codecademy</p>
						<p class="question">Why is this one of your favorite sites?</p>
						<p class="answer">This is one of the places that I realized that I loved to code!</p>
						<p class="question">What area of the site is your eye drawn to when looking at the homepage? Stand back further, what area is your eye drawn to now? Is that area the most important area of the site?</p>
						<p class="answer">The two areas that my eyes are drawn to are the text-line interface and the "sign-up" button.</p>
						<p class="question">How would you describe the website visually? List 5 adjectives. (i.e. "pretty", "elegant", "simple", "dark", "cluttered", "basic" etc)</p>
						<p class="answer">simple, minimalistic, sleek, dull, subdued</p>
						<p class="question">What problem does this website solve? What content does it have?</p>
						<p class="answer">This website gives people the opportunity to learn how to code. It gives simple information on what the purpose of the website is and provides a clear call to action.</p>
						<p class="question">What 5 adjectives would you use to describe the content, focus, and purpose of the site? (i.e. "practical", "fun", "whimsical", "silly", "serious" etc) How does that compare to the adjectives you used to describe the site visually?</p>
						<p class="answer">"simple, clear, unambiguous, instructional, and concise" -- These adjectives match the visual adjectives quite closely.</p>
						<p class="question">How easy is it to find what you are looking for from the homepage? How about from another page?</p>
						<p class="answer">It is very easy; everything has been laid out quite simply in plain view.</p>
						<p class="question">How easy is it to browse through all the content of the site?</p>
						<p class="answer">It is easy to browse through the content.</p>
						<p class="question">How do you feel after being on the site for a while? (i.e. "bored", "happy", "anxious or hyper", "like I wasted a lot of time" etc)</p>
						<p class="answer">I would be excited to get crackin'!</p>
						<p class="question">Does the site sell anything? If so, have you purchased any of it? Why or why not?</p>
						<p class="answer">The site sells the opportunity to learn, but for FREE! I've taken part in several tracks on Codecademy.</p>
